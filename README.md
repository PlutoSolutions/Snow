# [ info ]

![](https://i.imgur.com/DroawqE.png)

A Minecraft cheat that was made for 2b2t.org by chinks (therefore you should run this at your own risk)

Nobody here in PlutoSolutions plays on 2b2t so we can't say if this client is good or bad on 2b2t

# [ how-to ]

</div>

1. Download snowcrack.jar from the [releases page](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/Snow/releases)
0. Put it into your .minecraft/mods folder
0. Start the game

# [ issues ]

This client has baritone built in, so if you have -noverify in your jvm arguments you will probably get crashed

Other than that, there are probably no other issues
